Welcome to the Mastering Docker course.

Mastering Docker is a hands-on course offered by Anand Chitipothu. With unix-phiolosophy at its core, the course starts with understanding how to manage unix servers and continues to explore how to package software applications with Docker and run them in production.

By the end of this course, you'll not only know how to work with Docker, but leave with an appreciation for the simplicity of unix way and confidence to manage your own applications on a server.
