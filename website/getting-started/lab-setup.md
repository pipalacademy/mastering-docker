# The Lab Setup

A virtual machine in the cloud is created for every participant of the training.

You would have received an email with the details of the your node along with credentials to login.

The hostnames will be something like `alpha`, `beta`, `gamma`, etc.

_All the examples will use `alpha` as the name of the node. Please replace that with your hostname before trying._

Login to your server using ssh. The username is `pipal` for all the nodes.

```bash
$ ssh pipal@alpha.k8x.in
Password:
```

That'll prompt you for a password. Enter the password shared with you to login to ther server.
